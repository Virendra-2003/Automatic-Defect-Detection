# Automated Defect Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of an **automated defect detection system** for quality control in manufacturing. Traditional manual inspection methods are often error-prone, slow, and inconsistent. To address this, the system leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Image Processing (IP)** techniques in **MATLAB** to automatically classify metal parts as *defective* or *normal*.

The approach improves accuracy, reduces inspection time, and provides a scalable solution for real-time quality control in industries.

* Automated defect classification using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
* **MATLAB-based implementation** for image preprocessing, training, and testing
* Support for **real-time defect detection** through camera/image inputs
* Logging of defect data for analysis and corrective actions
* Comparative analysis of manual vs. automated inspection

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Image Acquisition** – Capture images of metal parts.
2. **Preprocessing** – Normalize, resize, and enhance images.
3. **Model Training** – Train CNN on labeled defect dataset.
4. **Prediction** – Classify new parts as *Defective* / *Normal*.
5. **Reporting** – Log results and generate defect reports.
